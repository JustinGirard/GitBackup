            "world_notes": "In the vast emptiness of space, a lone communications relay drifts, its metallic structure bearing the marks of countless years. The station, with various antennae and sensors extended outward, serves as a silent sentinel on the edge of known space, surrounded by faint stars and distant planets. Technology here is advanced yet worn, with cables and panels that show signs of age and repairs made over decades.",
            "global_visible_setting": "The station is set against a swirling gaseous nebula, vibrant with hues of purple, green, and blue. Tendrils of gas and dust twist around the station, giving it an ethereal, almost haunted appearance. Occasional bursts of light from distant stars cast shifting shadows across the station\u2019s surface, creating a dynamic, otherworldly backdrop.",
            "lighting_and_day": "Bathed in the dim, ambient glow of the nebula, with shifting shadows that emphasize the solitude and mystery of the relay. Small glimmers of light occasionally reflect off the relay\u2019s metallic panels.",
            "immediate_setting": "The immediate focus is the station itself: a compact, robust structure with several small docking ports and external panels. Exposed cables and conduits run along its surface, many appearing weathered and patched. Small red and green indicator lights flicker sporadically, hinting at the station\u2019s continued operation, albeit at minimal power.",
            "main_subject": "A weathered holographic map projector, mounted on the wall beside the hatch, flickers to life intermittently, displaying ethereal projections of star systems and navigation routes long abandoned. The map, marred by static and fading colors, features ghostly markers that pulse softly, hinting at lost ships and forgotten missions. Intricate patterns of light dance across its surface, evoking a sense of nostalgia for journeys once taken, while a faint whirring sound emanates from its core, as if it yearns to share its stories with those who dare to listen.",
            "camera": "The camera glides smoothly into the dimly lit compartment, framing the weathered holographic map projector in a slightly off-center composition, allowing the flickering projections to claim the viewer's attention. The surrounding walls, adorned with patches and exposed cables, create a rustic context that envelops the subject in a narrative of age and abandonment. Subtle shifts in lighting emphasize the ethereal glow of the map as it dances with fragmented star systems, while the soft whirring sound of the projector adds an auditory layer of intrigue. Shadows cast by the nearby docking ports stretch dramatically across the frame, enhancing the sense of isolation, while a distant nebula's colors bleed softly into the edges, reminding the viewer of the vastness beyond this forgotten outpost.",
            "tone": "The tone is solemn and introspective, highlighting the isolation of this lone outpost and hinting at forgotten missions and unspoken secrets.",
            "style": "Rendered in a cinematic style with high contrast and dramatic shadows, evoking both mystery and awe at the vastness of space.",
            "desired_resolution": "Target high resolution for intricate details on the station, especially on the hatch and control panel, to reveal every scratch, reflection, and shadow."
