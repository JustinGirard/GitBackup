            "world_notes": "In the vast emptiness of space, a lone communications relay drifts, its metallic structure bearing the marks of countless years. The station, with various antennae and sensors extended outward, serves as a silent sentinel on the edge of known space, surrounded by faint stars and distant planets. Technology here is advanced yet worn, with cables and panels that show signs of age and repairs made over decades.",
            "global_visible_setting": "The station is set against a swirling gaseous nebula, vibrant with hues of purple, green, and blue. Tendrils of gas and dust twist around the station, giving it an ethereal, almost haunted appearance. Occasional bursts of light from distant stars cast shifting shadows across the station’s surface, creating a dynamic, otherworldly backdrop.",
            "lighting_and_day": "Bathed in the dim, ambient glow of the nebula, with shifting shadows that emphasize the solitude and mystery of the relay. Small glimmers of light occasionally reflect off the relay’s metallic panels.",
            "immediate_setting": "The immediate focus is the station itself: a compact, robust structure with several small docking ports and external panels. Exposed cables and conduits run along its surface, many appearing weathered and patched. Small red and green indicator lights flicker sporadically, hinting at the station’s continued operation, albeit at minimal power.",
            "main_subject": "At the center of attention, a reinforced hatch with a control panel attached. The hatch has a locking mechanism, illuminated by a faint green light, suggesting it might still be operable. The control panel displays a flickering screen, its ancient interface designed for manual input.",
            "camera": "The camera is focused closely on the hatch and control panel, capturing the worn details of the metal surface, scratches, and patches.",
            "tone": "The tone is solemn and introspective, highlighting the isolation of this lone outpost and hinting at forgotten missions and unspoken secrets.",
            "style": "Rendered in a cinematic style with high contrast and dramatic shadows, evoking both mystery and awe at the vastness of space.",
            "desired_resolution": "Target high resolution for intricate details on the station, especially on the hatch and control panel, to reveal every scratch, reflection, and shadow."
